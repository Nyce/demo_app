This repo serves as a demo application that I created. It displays all of the current staff of the White House.
I used the MySQL relational database to display the key attributes of the White House staff (status, salaray,
position_title, etc.). I also coded features where the master user can add, edit, and delete the White House employees.

This is only my second official ruby on rails app.
